                I am originally from a small town in Northern New Mexico. When I tell <br>
                people I am from New Mexico, I usually get either one of two answers: <br>
                "Wow, you're the first person I've ever met from NM," or "so how do you <br>
                like breaking bad?" It's funny, because it's almost similar to the kind of <br>
                answers I get when I tell people I am learning how to code. I currently <br>
                work in the art world at a museum. When I explain to people that I am <br>
                enrolled in this course, it usually elicts a confused response.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to making people confused, coding, and being around art, I also like <br>
                to spend my free time eating icecream, hiking, reading, and the occational <br>
                Netflix binge.
